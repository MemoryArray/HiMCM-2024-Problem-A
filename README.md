This is a brief of the main points in the problem.

> As the Olympics evolve, the IOC aims to keep the Games both relevant and impactful by adding sports, disciplines, or events (SDEs) that resonate with modern values and appeal to a global audience. To guide these decisions, the IOC’s Olympic Programme Commission has developed a set of criteria to help ensure that each sport aligns with Olympic values. IOC Criteria for Sports 
> Inclusion is summarized below:
>
> -  Popularity and Accessibility: Enhances the Olympic Games’ appeal and global interest without excessively increasing costs or logistical demands.
> -  Gender Equity: Ensures that both men and women athletes have equal opportunity to participate.
> -  Sustainability: Promotes environmental and social responsibility.
> -  Inclusivity: Represents diverse cultures and promotes global participation (at least 75 countries across four continents practicing the sport).
> -  Relevance and Innovation: The sport must appeal to younger audiences, reflect modern trends, and incorporate innovations including physical virtual sports where appropriate while respecting Olympic traditions.
> -  Safety and Fair Play: Maintains high standards for athlete protection and anti-doping.

> The IOC has hired your team, HiMCM Olympic Consultants (HOC), to assist in evaluating which SDEs should be added (or potentially removed) from the 2032 Summer Games. Your task is to create a mathematical model that evaluates SDEs against these criteria to provide well reasoned recommendations. This model will be used to make quantitatively informed decisions about which SDEs best fit the Olympics’ evolving vision.
> **Your Tasks**
> 1. What factors need to be considered when addressing the IOC criteria? List and describe the various factors your team identifies. Note that factors may be quantitative or qualitative, constant or variable, and **deterministic** or **probabilistic**. Be sure to justify your choices and to include units where appropriate.
> 2. Use your factors to build a model (or set of models) to help the IOC evaluate which SDEs align best with Olympic criteria.
> 3. Test your model on at least three SDEs that have been added or removed from recent Olympics, namely Olympic years 2020, 2024, and 2028 and at least three SDEs that have continuously been in the Olympic programme since the 1988 games or earlier. The supplied data HiMCM_Olympic_Data.xlsx provides information about which sports and disciplines, and number of events, have appeared in each Olympics since their modern formation. Be sure to highlight the general applicability of your model by choosing a diverse collection of SDEs to evaluate. Discuss how your model affirms these SDEs’ current Olympic status.
> 4. Identify three SDEs that could be new additions or reintroductions for the 2032 Olympics in Brisbane. Make sure to identify which SDE should be considered first, second and third for inclusion in the Brisbane games. Are there any SDEs that you believe have potential for inclusion in an Olympic games in 2036 or beyond?
> 5. Perform sensitivity analysis to address the robustness of your model. Identify what aspects of your model make an SDE score well and discuss if these represent a strength or weakness of your model, especially in light of it being used as a decision-making tool.
> 6. Draft a one-to-two-page letter addressed to the IOC summarizing your findings in a nontechnical way. Explain your model’s rationale and its results for the evaluated SDEs. Include your recommendations for which SDEs to add or remove and why your model supports these conclusions.
